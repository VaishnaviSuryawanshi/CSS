    <p class="First">What is CSS?</p>
    <ol class="ol" type="1">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><s><b>CSS is not necessary</b></s><span class="one"><b>CSS saves a lot of work.</b></span> It can control the layout of multiple web paper, or in other media.</li>
<br>
<li id="p1">External stylesheets are stored in CSS files.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="First">CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</p>
    <ul class="ul" type=".">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements.</li>
        <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section.</li>
        <li>External - by using a link element to link an external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="one"><b>in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</b></span> because this is easier to demonstrate,
             and easier for you to try it yourself.</li>  
    </ul>
    <p class="p">When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.<br><br>

  In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of element on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.<br><br>

    There is a wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
